                  printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
                  specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but
                  also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
                  essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with
                  the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum
                  passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software
